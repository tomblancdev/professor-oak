### Levels
| Level    | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| starter  | No prior knowledge, absolute fundamentals |
| beginner | Basic concepts understood, building skills |
| advanced | Solid foundation, complex patterns |
| expert   | Deep knowledge, edge cases, optimization |

### Naming Conventions
- **Topics**: kebab-case (`docker-basics`, `python-async`)
- **Courses**: `[number]-[name].md` → `01-introduction.md`, `02-first-container.md`
- **Exercises**: `exercice-[number]/` → `exercice-01/`, `exercice-02/`
- **Extras**: `[date]-[name].md` → `2026-01-11-langchain-extension.md`

## The Learning Flow

1. **Choose a subject** → Track learning journey
2. **Assess level** → User selects: starter / beginner / advanced / expert
3. **Generate roadmap** → Claude creates roadmap for selected level
4. **Study courses** → Organized by level
5. **Practice exercises** → Reinforce learning
6. **Take quizzes** → Validate knowledge via Gym Leader + catch Pokemon
7. **Earn rewards** → Badges for level completion, Pokemon for quizzes
8. **Next level** → Complete level, unlock next, generate new roadmap
